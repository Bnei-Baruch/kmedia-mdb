00:00:02,130 --> 00:01:55,250
We'll read a source
 excerpt by Baal HaSulam.

1
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,820
When gladness comes to a person,

2
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:07,750
he should delve in words of
 Torah in order to discover the mind

3
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,310
of the Torah.

4
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:16,590
We must also know that gladness
 is an upper illumination that

5
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,160
appears by man.
 which is good deeds.

6
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,750
The Creator judges
 one where one is.

7
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,135
In other words,

8
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,710
if one takes upon himself the
 burden of the kingdom of heaven

9
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,695
for eternity, there is an
 immediate upper illumination on this,

10
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,100
which is considered eternity too.

11
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,850
let's read it again when
 gladness comes to a person he should

12
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,070
delve in words of Torah in
 order to discover the mind of the

13
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:08,050
Torah we must also know that
 gladness is discerned as upper

14
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:16,830
illumination that appears by man
 which is good deeds the creator

15
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:25,490
judges one where one is in other
 words if one takes upon himself

16
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,430
the burden of the kingdom of
 heaven for eternity there is an

17
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,690
immediate upper illumination on
 this which is considered eternity

18
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:51,785
too hello dear friends
 Hello dear friends It's

19
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:58,100
very easy to prepare for this
 gathering because the preparation

20
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,660
was the Congress two wonderful

21
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,670
days We prepared
 together Moscow 2,

22
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:16,560
Unity 5 and Ekaterinburg and
 the last two lessons are like two

23
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,019
points that connected into one
 line it shall help his friend

24
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,080
is the point from which we
 start and there is no one besides

25
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:38,679
him is the is the goal I guess
 men and women joined together

26
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,739
into this amazing journey where
 everything that was before is

27
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,080
finished and a new page is
 started for Nebo Uchanim passing

28
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,479
the mic to

29
00:04:49,580 --> 00:05:01,620
Valeo yes we have joy and
 gratitude we are all still some on

30
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,979
the way some haven't

31
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,739
yet reached the camera see this
 entire wonderful society sitting

32
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,580
together but we're

33
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,580
all together we are all
 together again and there is great joy

34
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,760
from the fact that we are
 going to hear the sacred words of

35
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,539
our sages once again it's

36
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,520
truly a great
 privilege to serve the

37
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,539
friends whoever it is wherever
 it is so that we should all simply

38
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,159
feel gratitude for everything
 we received and will receive so

39
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:42,200
Moskva one please our
 beloved friends Yes, to continue,

40
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:49,219
our dear friends after the
 Congress I got this feeling,

41
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,960
this impression that I'm

42
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,080
in the first lesson of the
 wisdom of Kabbalah the first lesson

43
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,130
I've ever been to and I'm
 seeing these huge friends,

44
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,140
thousands upon thousands who
 woke up early morning burning with

45
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,940
their desire and yearning
 for the Creator and they're

46
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,400
waiting with spiritual fear
 for the words of the Creator,

47
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,179
of the Teacher. And a new stage begins,
 a new blank page.

48
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,480
And on this blank page,

49
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:28,620
let us write only about
 connections of love, of the good,

50
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,659
mutual integration,
 the connection with the friends,

51
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,110
and nothing else.

52
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,580
And from this moment on,

53
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:46,179
it will be an instrument or a
 vessel that the Creator is waiting

54
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,440
for and is in complete
 harmony with the light that's

55
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:57,419
waiting for it. Friends,
 yesterday the Congress ended.

56
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,240
Every Congress is a step.

57
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,419
coming closer to our goal,
 to the connection between us,

58
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,150
to the revelation,
 even if you don't always realize it.

59
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,760
I want to share a little bit of my
 impressions from the Congress

60
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,290
that took place.

61
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,820
It turned out that we were on duty,

62
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,320
and during the

63
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:31,219
duty we went through all the
 rooms we saw the study hall some

64
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,539
people in the study hall some
 people were on broadcast there

65
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,520
were many people and we leave
 the study hall we come to the

66
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,299
kitchen and there are many
 people running around this way,

67
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,880
that way doing something,
 everyone is working You know,

68
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,520
the density of the friends was
 like one friend on a square meter,

69
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,090
even more. So we turned around,
 came to the next room.

70
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,799
The women were
 peeling vegetables.

71
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,620
Also, a long table,
 they sit there shoulder to shoulder,

72
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,170
working and working and working.

73
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:25,219
And then I simply remembered how
 many friends are sitting there

74
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,370
that we don't even see.
 The photographers, routers, organizers.

75
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,940
And the question was,

76
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,825
how many people serve the
 Congress in order for it to work?

77
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,650
Maybe not less than those who are
 actually sitting in the study

78
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,189
hall. then I thought
 that in truth it doesn't

79
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,350
even matter it is the same

80
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,290
people those who today were in
 the kitchen tomorrow will sit

81
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,370
in the study hall and the
 other way around in truth the

82
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,470
congress it's
 a living organism it's

83
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,209
one living

84
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:10,430
body in which everyone wherever
 they are give life to this body

85
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,840
they give life to this
 congress everyone is required,

86
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,230
everyone is important and
 everyone works together the reward

87
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,790
for the friends is the
 opportunity to work L 'chaim

88
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,490
friends and thank you very

89
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:40,709
much second source excerpt
 according to the importance one attributes

90
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,709
to the holy work to that extent he
 should give praise and thanks

91
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:52,949
for it this is so because it is
 true that we cannot appreciate

92
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:59,050
the importance of being able to
 sometimes observe the mitzvot

93
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,030
of the creator even without any

94
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:13,280
intention in that state one
 comes to feel elation and joy in

95
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,280
the heart and the praise and
 the gratitude one gives for it

96
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:25,100
expands the feelings and one is
 related by every single point

97
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,819
in the holy

98
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:35,100
work and he knows whose
 servant he is and thus soars ever

to Rav to thank the ten and to
 Rav and to Ravash and to Baal

132
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,570
HaSulam and the chain of
 Kabbalists who gave us this way,

133
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,069
they wrote the texts
 for us and they carry

134
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:47,630

135
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:54,490
of feeling of greatness and
 upliftment and importance each and

00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,410
everyone received we thank
 the creator for what he did for

137
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,970
us for giving us a
 place to exert we didn't

138
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,290
feel like we are

139
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:11,910
thieves like we are taking
 something for nothing and it's

140
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,329
really an upper force that can
 activate the system and give

141
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,630
place for the created beings
 and we want to be worthy of it

142
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,530
and we want to merit it and we
 hope that the result of all the

143
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,750
exertion we put in is the way we felt

144
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:33,150
it and give some
 contentment to him yes I think we're

145
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,250
not really able to

146
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,689
appreciate what we
 received in this congress it's

147
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,930
enough to simply give
 gratitude to the Creator because we did

148
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,189
feel the greatness
 and importance and

149
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:51,090
upliftment and there is this
 hidden place like Rav said that

150
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,010
this Congress was an important

151
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,670
landmark and it was a complete
 force that we were able to draw

152
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:03,590
to the world a force that
 balances so certainly this Congress

153
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,650
was a very important
 milestone and for that we need to be

154
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:12,890
grateful silent workshop let's

155
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,610

 heart and feel the creator
