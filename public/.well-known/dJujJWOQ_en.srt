00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:10,560
The writings of Rabash are
 article What are the tomes of prayer

1
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,375
and gratitude in the work?

2
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,490
Chazal Amru Our sages

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,630
said One should always
 establish the praise of the

4
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,480
Creator and then pray.

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:35,449
Chazal Amru They also said Rabbi
 Elazar said one should always

6
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,010
establish one's

7
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:44,150
prayer and then pray one should

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,350
understand why we must first
 establish the praise of the Creator

9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:01:01,710
when a person is in a state of
 deficiency and wants to pray

10
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:10,550
to the Creator to fill his lack,
 then he needs his help.

11
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:18,960
Thus, why should one first
 establish the praise of the Creator?

12
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,070
With a flesh and blood king,

13
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:29,590
we can understand that first we
 must show our respect for the

14
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:36,430
king so the king will see that
 we are among those who love him

15
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,170
and for this reason
 the king will grant our

16
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,530
wish but how can this be said
 with regard to the creator does

17
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:55,670
the creator need a person to
 show him that he is among those

18
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,350
who love the Creator and then
 the Creator will help him and

19
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,750
otherwise he will not.

20
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,270
After all, the Creator is
 merciful and gracious.

21
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,450
Although one is unworthy,

22
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,440
the Creator helps
 those who pray to Him.

23
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:28,399
As Bala Sulaim explained,
 what we say in the 18th prayer,

24
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,959
you hear the prayer of every mouth,

25
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:43,200
meaning that it does not
 matter what mouth prays,

26
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,670
but the prayer of any mouth.

27
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,790
Even if this mouth is unimportant,

28
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,610
still the Creator hears it

29
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:02,690
thus why must we first
 establish the praise of the

30
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:12,470
Creator in order to interpret
 this we should first present the

31
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,010
words of the

32
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,130
Zohar and

33
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:25,090
see and it came to pass before he
 concluded speaking that behold

34
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,850
Rebekah came

35
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:35,890
out it asks it should have said
 came as it is written Rachel

36
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,930
his daughter

37
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:45,650
comes why does it say come out he
 says that this indicates that

38
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,050
the creator took her out from
 among the townspeople who were

39
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,660
all wicked.

40
00:03:52,850 --> 00:04:00,590
And Rebekah came out and was
 separated from the rest of the

41
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,250
people in the city
 because she was righteous.

42
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:13,650
Rashi interprets the verse
 perhaps the woman does not walk.

43
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:19,829
He writes, it says, To me, perhaps,

44
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,630
and to me are spelled the same in Hebrew.
 Eliezer had a daughter.

45
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,530
He was looking for a reason
 that Abraham would turn to him to

46
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,440
marry his daughter.

47
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:38,150
Abraham said to him,
 My son is blessed, and you are cursed.

48
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,740
Cursed does not
 cling to the blessed.

49
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:50,210
should interpret the meaning
 of Isaac and Rebekah as well as

50
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:56,270
the matter of the daughter of
 Eliezer in the work the Zohar

51
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:08,289
writes he said to him my master
 shall say if he heard how the

52
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:14,929
authors of the Mishnah said this
 portion which they interpreted

53
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:22,650
concerning the soul that
 Abraham is the soul and Sarah is the

54
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:29,890
body in this manner we should
 interpret the matter of Isaac

55
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:38,130
and Rebekah as it is written in
 the Zohar Rabbi Yehuda said

56
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,490
his mother Sarah.

57
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:48,740
Since as the form of Isaac
 was as the form of Abraham,

58
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:57,180
similarly Rebekah's
 form was just as Sarah's.

59
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,900
This is why it is
 written his mother Sarah.

60
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:10,270
By this we should also
 interpret that that Isaac was the soul

61
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,390
and Rebekah the body.

62
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,370
In the order of man's work,

63
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,760
when he wants to achieve
 adhesion with the Creator,

64
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:29,650
he should always walk on two lines,
 right and left.

65
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,740
Right means wholeness.

66
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,729
When a person feels
 satisfaction in

67
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:48,450
work and praises and thanks the
 Creator for rewarding him with

68
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,460
being among the King's servants,

69
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:57,909
he sees that he has achieved a
 degree in spirituality which

70
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:04,950
is not so among the rest of
 the servants of the Creator.

71
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,770
yet he recognizes his lowliness
 and does not know why the Creator

72
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:18,729
chose him over other people who
 have not yet reached this degree

73
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:27,710
for this reason he thanks and
 praises the King and he can observe

74
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,690
what is written serve the Lord with

75
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:38,710
gladness at that time he has
 nothing for which to pray to the

76
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,969
creator to help him since
 he feels no length in his

77
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,370
situation however

78
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,989
later when a person
 goes to work on the left

79
00:07:53,090 --> 00:08:01,549
line meaning when he
 criticizes the state he is in and he sees

80
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:12,590
that he is flawed in mind and in
 heart and even worse he sometimes

81
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,849
sees how immersed he is in self

82
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:25,349
-love more than usual
 sometimes one comes to such loneliness

83
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:33,490
that he does not want the Creator
 to help him out of his lowliness

84
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:43,010
on the contrary he is angry
 that he is not receiving delight

85
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,390
and pleasure from the corporeal

86
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:53,949
life it follows that sometimes
 the left does not let him even

87
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,110
pray and ask of the

88
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:05,189
creator thus how can he feel
 himself as a whole person and thank

89
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,940
the creator

90
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:15,470
however we must know that the
 work is mainly during the ascent

91
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,550
only during an ascent
 can we speak of man's

92
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,150
work in two lines right and

93
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:31,150
left universally during a
 descent the person is considered dead

94
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:38,430
can we say that we are
 speaking to the dead or that we want

95
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:44,230
something from the dead that he
 will do something for this reason

96
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,230
when a person is in a state of

97
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:57,990
work it can be said that a
 person should work in two ways 1.

98
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:10,150
Right 2. Left Right means
 primarily that the wholeness in him

99
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:17,610
is built on above reason while the
 left in him is built specifically

100
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,850
on the reason and
 intellect that is,

101
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:30,590
at that time he judges
 himself as he sees as our sages said

102
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,750
a judge has only what his eyes

103
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:53,260
see he turns out that when he
 engages in the left and sees the

104
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,560
truth how lowly and
 immersed in self

105
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:07,480
-love he is how can he then say
 that he is in a state of wholeness

106
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:15,860
and be grateful to the
 Creator for giving him such a great

107
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,079
gift that he is in Kedushah,

108
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,220
holiness this is the
 complete opposite of the truth he

109
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:39,920
sees how can one be happy when
 he sees the truth the answer

110
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,959
is in two ways one it
 is written in the

111
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,860
essay concerning faith in his

112
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:56,660
teacher that Bala Sulaim said
 said that a person should go with

113
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,430
faith in the sages,
 as they have arranged it for us.

114
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,900
These are his words,
 slightly altered.

115
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,540
The student must believe,
 as his teacher tells him,

116
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,780
to walk on the path of
 right and wholeness.

117
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,540
The student should depict to

118
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,260
himself that he has already been
 rewarded with complete faith

119
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,120
in the Creator.

120
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:33,180
he already feels in his organs
 that the creator leads the whole

121
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,100
world as the good who does

122
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:42,860
good this means that the whole
 world receives from him only

123
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:51,720
good and although when he
 looks at himself he sees that he is

124
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:59,020
bare and destitute and also
 when he looks at the world he sees

125
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,459
that the whole world
 suffers torments each one

126
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,800
suffering according to his

127
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:15,560
degree he should say about this
 as it is written they have eyes

128
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:22,660
and see not that is as long as a
 person is in a state of they

129
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:32,860
that they have two authorities
 they cannot see the truth for

130
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:40,360
this reason the person must
 believe above reason that he is

131
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:50,060
in wholeness and so is the
 entire world it follows that in this

132
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:58,740
way he can and should thank the
 Creator for giving us abundance.

133
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,339
This is called the right line,

134
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,369
which is the complete
 opposite of the left line.

135
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,830
That is, in the left line,
 we walk within reason.

136
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,369
As was said, that a judge
 has only what his eyes see.

137
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,750
In other words,
 it is specifically with the intellect,

138
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,965
and not above reason.

139
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,620
But when shifting to
 work with the right,

140
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:43,400
the left is the cause that the
 right is built on the basis of

141
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:50,500
above reason.
 This is as our sages said.

142
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,714
the left rejects and the
 right brings closer.

143
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,420
In other words,

144
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:04,740
the state of left shows a person
 how he is rejected and separated

145
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,235
from the work of the Creator.

146
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,280
The right brings
 closer means that it shows

147
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:17,470
him that he is close to
 the work of the Creator.

148
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,030
This means that when he
 engages in the left,

149
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,910
the left should bring him to
 see a state of rejection,

150
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,890
that he is rejected and
 separated from the work.

151
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,160
when he engages in the right he
 should come to a state where

152
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,939
he sees that he is close to the

153
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,439
creator one should
 thank the creator for the

154
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,880
right and pray to
 the creator for the

155
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:06,100
left because only on two
 legs a person can walk in

156
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,280
corporeality this
 is extended from

157
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:16,980
spirituality and it shows
 that a person should walk on two

158
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:24,040
lines concerning the
 wholeness there is another

159
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,800
manner if a person comes to a
 state where he sees that he is

160
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:38,020
bare and destitute sees since
 he is behind both in mind and

161
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:47,439
in heart meaning he sees
 that he is immersed in self

162
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:53,699
-love and he sees
 that he does not have

163
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:03,140
anything that has any desire to
 work for the sake of the creator

164
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,080
now he sees that he has come to his
 true state called recognition

165
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,020
of evil he says that the fact
 that he now sees the recognition

166
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:22,160
of evil is a gift from
 above that he was shown the

167
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,240
truth otherwise he would deceive

168
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:32,540
himself and he would think that
 he does not need to change his

169
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,820
way since he is
 certainly walking on the path of

170
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,740
truth thus he could
 remain with his evil

171
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,720
forever but

172
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:51,760
now a revelation from above
 came to him to see the truth this

173
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,420
is as it is written in
 the Zohar about the

174
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,880
verse or make his sin down to

175
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:07,960
him it interprets that the
 creator notified him that he has

176
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:13,040
sinned meaning he was
 notified from above that he has

177
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:20,020
sinned in other words the
 recognition of evil is a revelation

178
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,720
from above for this reason he
 rejoices at the fact that that

179
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:34,660
the Creator tends to him and
 guides him and shows him his true

180
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:41,270
state. This gives him wholeness,

181
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,140
meaning from being rewarded
 with the revelation of the truth

182
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,460
from the hands of the Creator.

183
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,940
This discernment that he
 receives wholeness means that he says

184
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,780
that the creator is bringing
 him closer and he shows him the

185
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,320
truth it follows that now he's

186
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,220
not in a state where he says that
 the creator has rejected him

187
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,980
from Kedushah because he
 feels the bad on the contrary this

188
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,640
makes him

189
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:27,280
feel that the creator is
 bringing him closer which is called

190
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,620
the right brings

191
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:38,840
closer naturally in that state
 when he sees that he is entirely

192
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:45,940
bad he can overcome and seek
 advice how to emerge from this

193
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,720
evil hence he
 thanks and praises the

194
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:59,480
creator it follows that now he
 is regarded as blessed in that

195
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:05,620
he sees that he has received
 the knowledge from above about

196
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,100
the recognition of evil when he
 thanks the Creator he is certainly

197
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,900
considered blessed since he
 received a blessing from the Creator

198
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,940
and then he can come to
 adhesion with the Creator since the

199
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,440
blessed clings to
 the blessed this is

200
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:39,440
blessed it is
 written in the Zohar and

201
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:51,160
therefore although Eliezer
 was a sage he felt that he lacked

202
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,460
the quality of truth he was
 always in the state of the

203
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:03,660
left and always had grievances
 why the creator would not hear

204
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,460
him and give him a

205
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:14,570
soul since the
 light in it reforms him

206
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:22,740
although the left speaks to the
 point since everything is built

207
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,920
on reason as was said that the
 judge has only what his eyes

208
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:37,020
see but in truth he is
 cursed this is why Abraham told

209
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,420
him the cursed

210
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:48,680
meaning the body in a state of
 cursed cannot receive the instilling

211
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:57,284
of the Shekhinah regarded as one's
 personal soul.

212
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,705
This is so because the
 Shekhinah means Malchut,

213
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,625
which is the
 collection of the souls.

214
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,750
For this reason,
 Malchut is called the assembly of Israel.

215
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,770
Hence, in this state,

216
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,080
the body is unfit to
 receive the quality of Isaac,

217
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:25,660
who is called a soul it was said
 that the body is called wife

218
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,100
and the soul is called husband

219
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:40,340
however Rebecca means in the
 work that the body is everything

220
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,600
that the left shows it it's

221
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,080
true state that all its organs are

222
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:55,880
wicked that it understands only
 that which concerns itself of

223
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:03,140
that with regard to the
 benefit of the Creator it cannot do

224
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:14,520
a thing just as the left shows
 it this is the meaning of all

225
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,400
the townspeople were

226
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:25,040
wicked since the body is called
 a city as it is written a small

227
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:31,380
city with few people in
 it a great king came to

228
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,540
it and found in it a poor wise

229
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,320
man and he saved the city with his

230
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:48,680
wisdom Rebekah who was a single
 righteous woman came out from

231
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:56,020
among all the townspeople
 what does it say came out it says

232
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:02,820
that it indicates that the
 creator took her out from among all

233
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:11,080
the townspeople this means that
 this body felt itself as whole

234
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,660
meaning it's

235
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:12,940
righteous

236
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:22,240
because the creator notified
 it the truth from this it is glad

237
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:29,580
and this in itself is regarded
 as wholeness that the creator

238
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:38,080
notified it or for the second
 above reason that he believes

239
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:46,800
above reason that he has
 wholeness because he believes in faith

240
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:54,380
in his teacher that we must go
 above reason and say they have

241
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,400
eyes and see not in a state of

242
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:06,200
wholeness we can be rewarded
 with the state of Isaac who is

243
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:15,260
called a soul this means that
 the two opposites are in one body

244
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:24,940
but in two times we are told that
 the most important is to walk

245
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,600
on the right

246
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,900
line once he has a
 little bit of the left

247
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,860
line this is the meaning of one
 should always establish the

248
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,160
praise of the creator which is
 considered right and then pray

249
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:54,680
regarded as left and then
 he returns to the right

250
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:20,860
how are you doing?

251
00:26:22,940 --> 00:27:15,040
okay a little so we heard from
 here the time the time of prayer

252
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,940
and the time of

253
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:29,380
gratitude the person has
 recognition of evil he realizes that

254
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,740
as he writes here he's

255
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,600
wicked and

256
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,620
then the first section that he
 needs to do is prayer as I understand

257
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,740
it but then there is a certain
 change when he shifts to the

258
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,780
right he's

259
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,980
wicked he made a prayer what
 causes him to suddenly shift to

260
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,540
the right the prayer

261
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:03,980
the very fact that a person
 prays already brings him closer

262
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,560
to correct him
 correct him brings him

263
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:16,040
closer in order for a person to
 shift after the prayer to the

264
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,380
right line he should also
 receive a certain response to the

265
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,180
prayer or the very
 fact that he prays is

266
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:29,480
enough it depends on the
 degree of left and right that he's

267
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,720
in what degree

268
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,780
of coarseness he has to show to
 the creator from his current

269
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:48,230
state in the place where we are
 the moment a person discovers

270
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,850
that he is in the state of
 bad he is wicked, doesn't

271
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,810
want to connect with his friends
 everything we understand and

272
00:28:54,910 --> 00:29:01,810
he prays do we have any reason
 to delay after the prayer and

273
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,990
go to gratitude or after the
 prayer we immediately have to shift

274
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,950
there is reason to

275
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:15,270
delay typically when we are
 ready to pray we already think that

276
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:21,610
this is it now according to my
 words the Creator picks me

277
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:32,530
up and throws me from one end to
 the world to the other or vice

278
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,650
versa it doesn't
 matter from end to end meaning I'm

279
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:49,710
now proceeding in
 ascent changes it doesn't

280
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:55,030
always work this way but a
 person needs to go again and

281
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,430
again into a prayer and he has to
 feel like he has an opportunity

282
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:04,409
to incorporate in the friends and
 this is called and the Creator,

283
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:12,290
this is what it means and then
 to reach change several times

284
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,740
like that

285
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:22,460
on the left what does it mean
 one should always pray to the

286
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,920
Creator how does one
 erase the praise of the

287
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:30,040
Creator the praise of the
 Creator is something he arranges from

288
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,580
what is revealed to him the
 Creator is in the right,

289
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,440
in bestowal in

290
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,240
connection then he looks at

291
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:44,320
himself and he sees that
 relative to the creator he's

292
00:30:44,420 --> 00:31:07,370
in the left it says that during
 an ascent he's on two lines,

293
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,750
the left and the right
 but during a descent he's

294
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,490
considered as dead
 which means that there's

295
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,350
no connection between the left
 and the descent spirituality

296
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,010
is all built on an

297
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:30,870
ascent connection is called

298
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:40,850
right and to divide means
 the left the action of the

299
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:47,090
left but it says that only
 during the ascent it's

300
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:51,110
considered as working on two lines
 so the left also can be attributed

301
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,510
to the it can be used for an

302
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:59,270
ascent if he corrects
 the will to receive that

303
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,650
rises onto him then
 it means that he's

304
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,250
working on the

305
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,310
left but actually our work is
 to reach a state where we work

306
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:17,070
on two lines all the time in
 the direction of the goal

307
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:32,450
so the very fact that he feels
 the recognition of YIVO and he

308
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:38,090
acknowledges that this is
 actually it actually means nearing,

309
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:45,810
bringing closer it's

310
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,630
a place of work and then a
 person sees that he is approaching

311
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,170
Through the revelation of evil,

312
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:55,930
the Creator is bringing him closer.
 He cannot tolerate evil.

313
00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:01,250
He is drawn to cover the
 left using the right.

314
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:06,810
So when is the recognition of
 evil considered that he is being

315
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:07,770
pushed away?

316
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,410
When is it considered that the
 recognition of evil brings him

317
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,780
closer? Now is the
 time to come closer.

318
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:23,370
if the creator did not show him
 the evil in what way can a person

319
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,970
come closer what will he

320
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,630
cover yes but here he
 describes that the very fact that he's

321
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,430
shown the evil is already
 considered it is being brought closer

322
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,710
yes even before

323
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:42,310
he just by the recognition of
 evil by itself he already feels

324
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:42,650
that he's

325
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,310
being brought closer yes what
 about blessed and that he's

326
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:50,510
blessed and he's
 in wholeness yes but it's

327
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:50,870
still not

328
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:56,610
correction this is still
 done by the creator all of

329
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,830
it there is a state when they
 reveal the evil to him he feels

330
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,190
that he's

331
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,850
far away and he has to

332
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,170
pray there is also a state
 where they show him the evil and

333
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,110
he's grateful and
 he feels that he's

334
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,930
near but in both of them they
 show him the evil one time he

335
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,910
responds with a prayer
 another time he responds with

336
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,150
gratitude so what are these two

337
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:28,610
states by showing a
 person that he's

338
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,250
in the bad and the evil side he's

339
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,670
happy because he has a place of

340
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,970
work and the other

341
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:46,870
state where he has the evil
 but what is he happy he's

342
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:52,710
praying he's
 in prayer he can pray then he's

343
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:56,470
lacking wholeness but he's
 in prayer he's

344
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:04,810
happy because he has what to
 pray for if we take it a bit closer

345
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:09,230
to our issue for a minute how
 can a person when he feels that

346
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:13,530
he's disconnected far away he's
 condemning he's

347
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,310
criticizing etc the friends
 and the creator and the goal and

348
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,050
everything how can he
 be in a state where he's

349
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:29,690
happy and rejoicing and say no he's
 happy and joyous after he's

350
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:33,630
made the action of
 correction here you're

351
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:41,150
simply explaining to us the
 state this means that he can't

352
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,290
be in a state where he's

353
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,670
happy and rejoicing when
 they reveal to him that he's

354
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:50,510
far away yes but it's

355
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:56,990
following not simply a joyous
 state rather a state that he completed

356
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,570
he made whole he
 completed it of course he's

357
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,150
happy but here he
 describes a state where the very,

358
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,710
just the fact that the
 recognition of evil only in itself the

359
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,770
fact that he was shown
 that he is far away,

360
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,190
he is already in a state where
 this recognition of evil is a

361
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:16,830
revelation from above yes,
 of course it's

362
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:17,670
a revelation from

363
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:23,030
above so how to be in this
 state where he is shown the evil,

364
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,750
that he is far away and
 already he is in wholeness and in

365
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,170
joy he is still not in

366
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:39,790
wholeness because when he on
 top of the revelation of evil he

367
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:44,210
draws the power from
 above and he raises

368
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,990
himself and then he can be

369
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:55,110
happy as a result of arranging
 the connection between the two

370
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:19,689
lines How can one not stay as a fool?
 What does he depend on?

371
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:23,920
Using his own powers.
 What he went through.

372
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:28,390
Is this a person's
 personal overcoming? Yes.

373
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:31,770
Yesterday we talked a lot about
 the person cannot deliver him

374
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:38,190
from imprisonment only the
 friend can elevate his friend. Yes.

375
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,800
So is it within his own power or
 by the power of the friends?

376
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:53,580
Yes. What do you mean yes? Which one?
 You decide. Okay, thanks.

377
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:00,840
You can give up as far as I'm
 concerned. Okay, I give up.

378
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,140
No, guys.

379
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,810
I'm not telling you, seriously,
 ask one another, I couldn't

380
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:13,990
sleep, I couldn't sleep,
 because I was so tired,

381
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:22,810
this congress was very difficult,
 very heavy,

382
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:35,410
I went through it,

383
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:49,620
but after it was over I felt I
 was drained to zero if we're

384
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:56,900
talking about it already what
 makes Rav feel drained exhausted

385
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:05,780
or not exhausted physical
 state first of all truly physical

386
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:15,180
state as a result of all the
 stress and the pressure although

387
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,240
I'm not stressed myself
 personally but for some reason when

388
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:26,600
the action was finished I wasn't

389
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,680
able to do anything not with
 my brain not with my heart not

390
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:43,640
physically, nothing so I'm
 waiting for it to pass it's

391
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,780
always like this
 following congresses there's

392
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,440
some time that not to that

393
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,500
extent this congress

394
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,040
was way more

395
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:58,720
powerful so the fact that Rav
 is drained is that a good sign

396
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,120
or a bad sign for the
 students that's

397
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,620
good you mean for the
 students wait and see I think it's

398
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,120
good I think it's
 good for everyone it's

399
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,900
a sign that we did work or it's

400
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
a sign we were
 negligent or sure it's

401
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,840
a sign that there was

402
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:26,520
work by everyone who were
 present and was working it was good

403
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:37,320
do some reading how to do
 it technically what's

404
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,900
the correct way of working in order

405
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,400
to receive the new light that
 is coming in the form of these

406
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:54,350
vessels I think that the most
 important is to connect with other

407
00:40:54,450 --> 00:41:00,190
friends and together to already

408
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:08,690
accept help or bestow maybe a
 better way to say it the external

409
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,150
bestowal from other

410
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:17,050
tents but nevertheless
 this way or that way it's

411
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:21,510
the fact that it's
 moving by itself it's

412
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:24,970
clear but we sit
 here we know that it's

413
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:29,330
going to pass but we also want
 to be participating we want to

414
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,390
participate correctly in this

415
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:47,110
process what did you feel
 special in this congress you didn't

416
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:55,510
feel in past congresses I
 felt much more power in the

417
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,770
connection in
 shifting from one state to

418
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:06,070
another that is the people,

419
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:16,230
the audience that was in the
 Congress was an audience that studies,

420
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:22,330
that undergoes changes and
 this is how they went through it

421
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:26,610
this is the main thing I

422
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:32,630
felt so what did you mean
 by saying it was a little

423
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:44,080
heavy well it was heavy heavy doesn't
 mean bad it's

424
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:48,440
not that it's
 bad but rather heavy it's

425
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:53,260
like a donkey or a person it doesn't

426
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,800
matter how you say it that
 carries a bag full or a sack full

427
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:04,520
of gold coins on the one hand it
 carries it for itself on the

428
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,340
other hand in
 between it is hard it's

429
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,320
heavy and from here

430
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:19,160
on and from here on well it
 depends on how much you will be

431
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,440
able to be

432
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:28,360
flexible in all of these
 states and see which state awakens

433
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:39,040
you and which one doesn't
 etc Can you expand about this flexibility?

434
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:50,300
No, it's better if we speak
 from what we are going through.

435
00:43:50,940 --> 00:44:04,760
It would be better this way.
 Good. 600 ,000 souls.

436
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,980
It is said that there
 are 600 ,000 souls,

437
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:16,320
and each soul divides
 into several sparks.

438
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:24,380
We must understand how it is
 possible for the spiritual to divide,

439
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,180
since initially only
 one soul was created,

440
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,490
the soul of Adam HaRishon.

441
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:41,620
In my opinion,
 there is indeed only one soul in the world,

442
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,180
as it is written,

443
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:50,270
and breathed into his
 nostrils the soul of life.

444
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:55,480
That same soul exists in
 all the children of Israel,

445
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:03,245
complete in each and every one,
 as in Adam HaRishon.

446
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:12,310
since the spiritual is
 indivisible and cannot be cut which is

447
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,030
rather a trait of corporeal

448
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:21,370
things rather saying
 that there are 600 ,000

449
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:30,150
souls and sparks of souls
 appears as though it is divided by

450
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:38,270
the force of the body of each
 person in other words first the

451
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:44,530
body divides and completely
 denies him of the radiance of the

452
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:52,750
soul and by the force of the
 Torah and the mitzvah the body

453
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,470
is cleansed and to the extent of its

454
00:45:56,570 --> 00:46:01,910
cleansing the
 common soul shines on him

455
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:11,800
for this reason two
 discernments were made in the corporeal

456
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:17,940
body in the first
 discernment one feels one's

457
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:24,400
soul as a unique organ and does
 not understand that this is

458
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:24,880
the whole of

459
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:34,040
Israel this is truly a flaw hence
 it causes along with the above

460
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:39,800
mentioned in the second
 discernment the true light of the soul

461
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:45,260
of Israel does not shine on him in
 all its power of illumination

462
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:52,040
but only partially by the
 measure he has purified himself by

463
00:46:52,140 --> 00:47:05,260
returning to the
 collective the sign for the body's

464
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:12,320
complete correction is
 when one feels that one's

465
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:18,400
soul exists in the whole of
 Israel each and every one of

466
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:26,460
them for which he does not feel
 himself as an individual for

467
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,580
one depends on the

468
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,860
other at that time he is complete

469
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:41,320
flawless and the soul truly
 shines on him in its fullest power

470
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:51,380
as it appeared in Adam HaRishon
 as in he who breathed from within

471
00:47:51,480 --> 00:48:06,870
him what is the first state he
 writes about here that one feels

472
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:11,490
one's soul as an individual and he doesn't
 understand it's

473
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,110
the whole of Israel that's

474
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:14,750
how a person

475
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:19,350
starts yearning to
 understand who am I what am I,

476
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,570
what a soul is,

477
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,170
what the creator is and so

478
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:31,870
on so in the first phase he
 still feels his soul as a unique

479
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:40,500
detail and he doesn't

480
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,680
understand that that is the whole
 of Israel that he has a connection

481
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:53,920
to the collective of the whole
 spiritual vessel that is now

482
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,560
starting to be revealed
 to a person and that is a

483
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:12,220
flaw because it comes from him
 feeling his soul as something

484
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,040
that is sliced from the
 collective as something

485
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:25,120
individual and why does he say
 that he feels his soul meaning

486
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:29,420
he already has some
 feeling he feels that it's

487
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,900
his internality
 but he still doesn't

488
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,620
feel it as a part of a
 collective that he's

489
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,840
connected to the collective
 he feels that he has it in him as

490
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:46,860
his soul and he lives and
 exists supposedly outside of the

491
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:55,500
others and in the second state
 where he says the true light

492
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,440
of the soul of Israel doesn't

493
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:03,380
illuminate in all its power
 but only partially what does it

494
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,020
mean partially part of that
 illumination that shines so he writes,

495
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:14,100
keep reading by the measure he has
 purified himself by returning

496
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:21,480
to the collective as much as he
 connects to the collective in

497
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:27,720
such a way to that measure he
 purifies his soul and he feels

498
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,040
that he's

499
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,120
part of that collective

500
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:45,380
what does it mean the
 state described here

501
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:55,220
that the soul appears in all
 its power as it appeared in Adam

502
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,660
Alishon I don't
 know that state itself I don't

503
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,860
attain but according to what
 is written you can say that by

504
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:12,200
man doing that and
 connecting to the upper root he can

505
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:18,800
reveal that light that is
 extended upon him from

506
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:29,940
above well when we connect
 with the friends with the points

507
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:37,160
in the heart we connect with
 individual souls or a single

508
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:42,160
soul we connect to individual

509
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:47,420
souls between
 themselves and the more we connect

510
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:57,740
we connect them into one one whole,
 collective whole.

511
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:03,790
And the common part,
 is that some part of the soul of Adam Arishon?

512
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:06,630
Yes, of course.

513
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:15,410
What does it mean 600 ,000
 if there's only one soul?

514
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,310
We've learned it, and we'll

515
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,540
learn more about the
 shattering of the parzuf.

516
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:35,210
that is put together from six
 parts like Zaranpin that's

517
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:37,450
why it was shattered into 600 ,000

518
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:47,690
parts it is

519
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:54,430
written according to the
 measure he was purified the common

520
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:55,690
soul shines on

521
00:52:55,790 --> 00:53:00,450
him according to the measure who
 is purified what is the measure

522
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:04,370
of purification corrected it's

523
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:10,690
coarseness of yud and then
 what happens then more light can

524
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:14,290
come from
 surrounding light to inner

525
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:17,670
light and then the general

526
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:23,830
soul can shine on him there is also
 expression here the collective

527
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:28,670
of Israel what is that
 collective of Israel the general soul

528
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:37,730
what is in him there's

529
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:44,150
no other division besides the
 vessels that are working in order

530
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:50,690
to bestow according to their
 intention their direction they're

531
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:54,890
called Israel straight
 to the creator that's

532
00:53:54,990 --> 00:54:01,390
it the individual that
 purifies himself and comes closer to

533
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:05,890
that collective there's
 a collective soul there's

534
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:11,030
a collective of Israel that
 individual starts purifying when

535
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:14,670
he yes so accordingly that's

536
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:18,750
how he enters the whole
 collective that force of the whole

537
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:26,830
those who already corrected
 themselves in the intention to bestow

538
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,590
and they've

539
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:41,810
entered a single force with the
 Creator and that structure of

540
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:45,270
the collective that he's
 already won he's

541
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:50,790
already in unity with the
 Creator yes so that one that wants

542
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:55,350
to purify in what what's

543
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:59,890
the line that brings him to
 incorporate in this corrected thing

544
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:00,370
that he's

545
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:06,390
already united in the root
 of the soul the root of his

546
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:10,950
soul let's

547
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:11,630
say now in the

548
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:20,410
convention some collective
 was felt yes what is that force of

549
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:28,070
the collective that is huge it's
 a force what's a force?

550
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:35,290
a force that attracts towards
 the creator the final correction

551
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:55,260
connection between us all of
 it is a force yes First of all,

552
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,020
especially today it
 feels like there's

553
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,780
a feeling of what Baal HaSolom
 writes in this article and gratitude

554
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:06,980
that we have such a righteous in
 the generation who knows the

555
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:13,300
entire soul and conveys it in
 such a way that there is someone

556
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,100
who knows everything it's

557
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,820
something very unique and he
 also knows how to deliver it in

558
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,240
a way that in our generation
 we can feel that Rav, yes,

559
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:24,580
Bar As

560
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:30,860
-Sulam was awarded with
 all the degrees yes it's

561
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,220
felt everywhere
 and I wanted to ask,

562
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:39,490
he talks about the individual who
 begins to return to the collective,

563
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,420
so it seems like there's

564
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,520
two aspects here according to
 the article and also the feeling

565
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,980
there's the individual who
 feels the whole of Israel israel

566
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:55,860
and basically where is or why
 is there a 10 in the way it feels

567
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,460
like it has to be there so the
 person can return to the collective

568
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,000
but it's unclear where is it on
 the way technically speaking

569
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,460
like a person must have it but it's

570
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,660
unclear where it is between the
 individual and feeling the whole

571
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,940
of Israel to its

572
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:21,360
generations so the individual who
 listens to the advice of Kabbalists

573
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,980
about how to return to the

574
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,240
whole that he has to bring

575
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:32,080
himself to an intention to
 bestow as one man in one heart and

576
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,180
so forth so that

577
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,860
individual returns and that is his

578
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,700
correction and what is the
 structure of the tent that he's

579
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:50,260
in maybe it is but where does
 the general soul shine on him

580
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,800
specifically during
 the tent through the

581
00:57:52,900 --> 00:58:00,600
tent how does a person feel the
 collective of Israel and our

582
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,040
generations through the
 structure of the tent doesn't

583
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,840
it restrict them we don't

584
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:15,980
understand how the tent
 which seems to us like something

585
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:25,700
individual and temporary
 and coincidental that's

586
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:32,680
most important that's
 what it seems we don't

587
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:38,380
see that it can actually bring
 each and every person to the

588
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:47,060
goal to a connection to bring
 him to his place to his true final

589
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:59,510
stop yes maybe a strange
 question but what is Baal HaSulam's

590
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,630
method what's

591
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:08,450
the essence of his method
 the essence of the method is

592
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:16,610
truth that there's

593
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:23,790
nothing besides a force in man
 a force in the creator and the

594
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:24,410
connection between

595
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:31,570
them to the extent that one can
 use his force and the creator's

596
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:37,210
force that is bestowed
 upon him that shines on

597
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:44,970
him according to that a person
 advances towards his source that's

598
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:51,130
it yesterday when we read none
 else besides him so it was clear

599
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:54,250
that it's like Barasulam's
 creation but it's

600
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:57,010
as our sages said they wrote it's

601
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:03,190
like he gathers a lot of
 things all those things it's

602
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:07,710
like they concentrate a lot of
 sources that already exist what

603
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:11,819
did he add into there
 that makes it a method,

604
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,230
his method because
 you feel that there's

605
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:14,750
something in

606
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:24,530
him look Bar Suram only
 worked in the 20th century before

607
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:28,410
him many Kabbalists were

608
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:36,670
active also in his generation
 there were a few so you can't

609
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:44,210
say that this is the one and only
 Kabbalist sent by the creator

610
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:54,590
and that's
 it however practically what's

611
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:59,390
unique about him is that he
 received permission from above and

612
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:05,170
opened to us a very important
 part of the wisdom of Kabbalah

613
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:07,250
that discusses man's

614
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:14,770
correction which before
 Bartholomew was very difficult to understand

615
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:20,130
to attain and people had to go
 through like he explains in one

616
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:22,750
of the sources you don't

617
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:28,570
remember the seven wisdoms
 yeah the seven wisdoms all kinds

618
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:30,530
of things like that it's

619
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:38,550
not simple and for us
 essentially basically everyone can come

620
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:46,050
closer and reach it so he
 actually took the whole path and inner

621
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:50,150
work and he took the essence of
 it into something very precise

622
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,910
without all the yes if

623
01:01:54,010 --> 01:02:01,890
you if you read

624
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:12,070
him word after word in trying
 to feel these words a bit from

625
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:23,770
within then we see he wrote this
 to those who wish to feel because

626
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:33,750
the most important thing is
 feeling some people it's

627
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:39,490
very hard for them
 to rise above their

628
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:55,960
feeling should the tents
 conclude the congress they went

629
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,220
through it's

630
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:58,760
desirable

631
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:04,220
yeah recommended to discuss in
 the tent what we went through,

632
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:11,000
how we came out of it and what
 are we doing next to make it

633
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,580
clear to everyone thank
