00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,259
Shalom to you,
 thank you for joining me.

1
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,520
We are here with a brief summary
 of the series of programs with

2
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,959
Dr. Michael Eitman
 and Yael Leshed Arel.

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,959
Today in the program we will
 try to find a real solution,

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,660
a solution from the
 root to cyber threats.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,520
For those who are not
 familiar with the details,

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,180
we are in a time when there are
 cyber attacks, cyber wars.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,199
A cyber attack means that we
 are using a remote control over

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,900
a person's account, an organization's
 or a state's account,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,580
in order to destroy their life cycle.
 How do we solve this?

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,900
This is what I want to
 discuss today, a very,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,460
very challenging question.
 Let's start with the first part.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,710
Time to wake up, please.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,640
In the past,
 we had something to wake up.

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,360
There was a record that
 you could enter into,

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,120
and before that there was a
 kind of shield that you could put

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,160
in front of your body,
 and after that it couldn't reach you.

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,120
Today, you're really, really,
 really, really exposed.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,320
How do you deal, in your opinion,
 how can you deal,

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,250
in your opinion,
 with this abstract phenomenon?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,060
I don't know what to tell you.
 You have a bank of money.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,840
Suddenly, there's a zero.
 Or even a minus, let's say. Even worse.

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,610
Yes, 50 ,000 dollars.

23
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:32,370
And you say, no, it can't
 be, but there is a fact,

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,400
yes, with everything,
 in the hospital, everywhere,

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,480
suddenly all the medical
 supplies are taken away,

26
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:51,060
they bring you, I mean,
 it can be, we are not aware of it.

27
00:01:51,160 --> 00:02:01,070
But if we go into the industry,
 nuclear power plants, and trains,

28
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,620
planes in the sky, all kinds of...

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:14,590
It's all controlled by the system.
 It's thought. We can't just...

30
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,440
find ourselves here.
 How do you deal with it?

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,640
This is already known,
 what I said. How do we deal with it?

32
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,860
In the end, we cannot deal with
 it until we change ourselves.

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,040
Because dealing with it is only
 possible if the human beings

34
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,280
are good and do not
 want to hurt each other.

35
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,000
Or at least not all human beings,
 but states, governments,

36
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:56,820
all kinds of large
 organizations that are strong enough to do

37
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,720
this. so at least
 those and we will be

38
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:10,880
able to act for the whole world
 as a system of great protection

39
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,160
Is there in the development of
 the will of humanity some stage

40
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,120
where the will of the person
 will become a will for good?

41
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,240
No So how did it happen?

42
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,920
It was already done by special

43
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:31,460
education but to decide that we
 must We have to live in a world

44
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,899
where everyone is
 open to everyone.

45
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,060
We are all connected to each other.
 We can all be hurt.

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,200
A small child can
 hurt the whole world.

47
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,430
Well, theoretically,
 but in any case. So we have no choice.

48
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,620
We have to think about what
 we are doing in the trial.

49
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,140
Mike Roms, it still
 sounds like something very,

50
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,440
very good to me.

51
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,900
What will really cause people,
 and certainly governments,

52
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,000
who have some kind of desire to use
 all their strength and control

53
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,180
and all these games,
 what will really cause them, in the end,

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,220
to decide that they want to
 act in the direction of good?

55
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,060
To teach in the direction of good?

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:20,640
Fear, fear, and fear of loss,
 something big, something important.

57
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,739
What does this mean,

58
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,479
that they will work so that they
 really want to start fighting

59
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,700
one with the other and not
 control one with the other,

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,940
that this is the situation today?

61
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,580
Today it is also so obvious
 that you already know, you don't

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,470
even hide it. No, it is clear.

63
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,930
If people see that
 they have no choice,

64
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,470
and they are
 completely dependent on it,

65
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,840
that my life is in the hands of someone,
 then there is no choice,

66
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,330
I am looking for how I can be
 with him and it is a success.

67
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,560
So there has to be a danger of
 life here in order for something

68
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,580
to happen? Yes,
 but we have a clear danger of life here.

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,400
This cyber is... Is it leading to there?
 It's not leading.

70
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:08,320
It's in terms of the closest,
 the most direct to the human life.

71
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,050
To this place,
 the complex and the complex,

72
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,870
we arrived by means of
 research and development.

73
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,299
We developed from generation to generation,
 from year to year,

74
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,640
and we developed technologies
 that connect us all today in one

75
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:52,060
small village, Let's
 see the next slide. I mean, what is it?

76
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,039
This cyber exists because
 someone implements it.

77
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,860
I can implement it for good,
 I can implement it for bad.

78
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,240
So who does it depend on?
 On a person, on human beings.

79
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,539
So you're
 saying that the change...

80
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,990
On a person's character,
 on his development level.

81
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,780
So you're

82
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,719
saying that this is the only
 solution that you can see at the

83
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,140
moment? There is no
 other solution.

84
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,840
If I stand,
 I already said this to Oren,

85
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,820
if I stand and I have the
 possibility to press the button and

86
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,919
do what I want in the world,
 or this, or that,

87
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,730
or all kinds of things.
 That's it. So I press.

88
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,850
So I press the button
 and give an order.

89
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,679
Please destroy this city,
 but before that,

90
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,070
send me pizza and cola.
 What will cause us... That's it.

91
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,840
Instead of
 developing today all kinds

92
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,320
of technological or
 commercial ideas,

93
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,979
what will cause us as a human
 being to develop good human beings?

94
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,320
That this will be our
 next development,

95
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,200
instead of developing all kinds of...
 So they have to do it.

96
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,640
There is such a program called
 Kabbalah that can teach people

97
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,400
to be good people and to
 inspire them and to influence them

98
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,669
and to change the whole human society.
 What is it? It exists.

99
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,419
And it is really waiting
 for such a situation in

100
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:20,140
humanity And what
 would make it possible,

101
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,510
what would be the motivation of people,
 of countries,

102
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,500
to live in peace,
 to do good to each other?

103
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,080
What would be this
 inner motivation?

104
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,919
Oh, this is a completely
 different inner motivation.

105
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,760
It's not just to live well in
 this world and to enjoy all kinds

106
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,780
of things in silence and in peace,

107
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,140
that you have a
 family and children.

108
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,900
We don't want a family, we don't
 want children, we don't

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,480
even want to live. And that remains,
 you say? These are nonsense.

110
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,859
By changing our nature,
 we are moving to another life,

111
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,940
to a different dimension.

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,659
Because in our dimension,
 we have already been blinded.

113
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,730
We don't want to live at all.

114
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,520
I include all my life that I live in.

115
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,880
you know how many people in the
 world are in depression and

116
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,719
want to get rid of this life
 and they are getting rid of it

117
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,200
with as much joy as possible so
 they go to Samis it's like that,

118
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,780
they exist,

119
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,140
there is no

120
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,520
choice but the change of
 nature of man is not only that gives

121
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,919
us the security to exist it doesn't

122
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,179
matter for this
 security it doesn't

123
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,500
matter to

124
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,659
exist I need to show people
 that they have a new age a new

125
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:52,880
level What kind of world?

126
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,939
We will see an endless world,
 a perfect one,

127
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,030
where there will be endless
 opportunities and abilities,

128
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,319
and everything
 before everyone else.

129
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,760
What I understood is that the
 world we love is the result or

130
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,079
the reflection of who
 we are as human beings.

131
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,480
It turns out that if we change
 ourselves as human beings,

132
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,000
we will also receive
 a different world.

133
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,840
Let's see in the next section
 how Rabbi Leitman continues to

134
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:48,200
develop this amazing idea.

135
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,260
He enjoys the fact that he
 influences and gives to everyone

136
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,350
instead of receiving
 and collecting. Why?

137
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,270
Because then he is not limited.

138
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
Because in the
 houses that I receive,

139
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,260
there is a limit to how
 much I can receive.

140
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,600
In food, money, family,
 money, how much can I receive?

141
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,859
I am very limited.

142
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,620
In the end, from the fact that
 I am trying to kill myself,

143
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,050
I die. But for a person who lives
 in the direction of influence,

144
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,310
he is not limited.

145
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,130
Because you can influence,
 from your life you have no end.

146
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,780
And therefore you can enjoy the
 influence in an unlimited way.

147
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,500
A person who advances to the level of
 this recognition and understanding

148
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,630
of reality,

149
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,980
is he in your eyes the same good
 man you talked about earlier,

150
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,880
First of all,
 he can only protect the world.

151
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,500
As long as we are good in ourselves,

152
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,250
then this world will be
 a safe place. Right.

153
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,520
Now, I understood the
 perception of the world of one person.

154
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,540
Let's be a little more careful.

155
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,520
A society that has good people in it.
 Yes. How does it function?

156
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,780
A world that has good people in it.
 How does it function?

157
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,560
What is it different
 from our world today?

158
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,360
They function in a friendly way,
 this, this, this, this.

159
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,220
That everyone gives to everyone
 and everyone keeps everyone.

160
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,980
And then they are in a state of
 general love between them,

161
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,540
and then they create between
 them such an area of love that

162
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,760
gives them the
 feeling of the next level,

163
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,640
that they live in
 giving and love, and don't

164
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,420
need to get anything at all.
 How do we use the cyber space?

165
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:50,760
You want to connect with
 everyone in the most open program that

166
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:57,260
can be, and to connect
 with everyone so that

167
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,590
the connection will be
 completely open between everyone,

168
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:11,460
And everyone will become one brain,
 one will, one promotion.

169
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:17,610
And all humanity,
 in its individuality, will disappear.

170
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,810
And every person will feel
 everything that is in everyone.

171
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,390
That is, he will be boundless.

172
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,530
Is there also a heart in this story?

173
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,960
Or is it all just
 rational and cold and magic?

174
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,430
Everything is in a feeling
 and in a brain, together.

175
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:39,579
Shiluv, so in the end,
 I have to say more, so in the end,

176
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,199
the human beings
 become so connected.

177
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,290
They become human, like there was once,
 one will, one thought,

178
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,710
one feeling, one person,
 and divided into many parts,

179
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,980
to human beings.

180
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,960
Again, these people connect
 together in one desire, in one thought,

181
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:09,099
in one heart. And that's
 what exists in complete. Another question.

182
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,030
What would be the result of
 this situation where they're

183
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,690
all connected like one?

184
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,780
No child will get up and press
 enter and do this. Exactly.

185
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:24,200
Because the general idea
 that we have in our eyes,

186
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,450
communication and love,

187
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,530
is that he will hold
 everyone to be like that.

188
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,569
This is a kind of anti 
-virus.

189
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,610
This is a general field of anti

190
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,770
-virus. The general field of
 communication and love is to keep

191
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,770
us safe. Happy life. All the best.
